In this analysis, I counted how many times Jim said the name “Pam” / “Pamela” per episode in every season. The graph is also color-coded by season: getting a lighter shade of blue as the seasons progress. Based on the data, Jim said the name “Pam” the most on episode 4 collectively throughout every season, and this trend would decrease the longer a season went on. Ultimately, Jim referenced “Pam” in 123 episodes throughout the course of the TV show.\n\n# detect whenever somebody laughs\nlaugh_counts &lt;- office_lines |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect\n         (str_to_lower\n           (str_trim(Line)), \"\\\\[laughing\\\\]|\\\\[laughs\\\\]\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Episode_Number, Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  head(n = 10)\n\n# create a table indicating laugh counts\nkable(laugh_counts, caption = \"Top 10 Laugh Counts by Season and Episode\")\n\n\nTop 10 Laugh Counts by Season and Episode\n\n\nEpisode_Number\nSeason\nn\n\n\n\n\n10\n8\n13\n\n\n18\n9\n13\n\n\n6\n1\n11\n\n\n23\n3\n11\n\n\n23\n9\n11\n\n\n5\n9\n8\n\n\n13\n7\n8\n\n\n1\n1\n7\n\n\n4\n1\n7\n\n\n16\n9\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Office” is well known for their improvisations and breaking of character, leading to genuine laughter adding on to the already scripted occurrences. The above table shows a list of the Top 10 episodes in which characters laughed during their lines. This displays how Season 8, Episode 10 and Season 9, Episode 18 have the most laughter within the episode, at a total of 13 laughs. Surprisingly, these episodes actually do not parallel with what fans think are the “funniest episodes.” ScreenRant ranked Season 2, Episode 12 as the funniest episode and Collider ranked Season 4, Episode 13 the funniest."
