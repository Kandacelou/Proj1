In this analysis, I counted how many times Jim said the name “Pam” / “Pamela” per episode in every season. The graph is also color-coded by season: getting a lighter shade of blue as the seasons progress. Based on the data, Jim said the name “Pam” the most on episode 4 collectively throughout every season, and this trend would decrease the longer a season went on. Ultimately, Jim referenced “Pam” in 123 episodes throughout the course of the TV show.\n\n# detect whenever somebody laughs\nlaugh_counts &lt;- office_lines |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect\n         (str_to_lower\n           (str_trim(Line)), \"\\\\[laughing\\\\]|\\\\[laughs\\\\]\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Episode_Number, Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# create a table indicating laugh counts\nkable(laugh_counts, caption = \"Summary of Laugh Counts by Character and Episode\")\n\n\nSummary of Laugh Counts by Character and Episode\n\n\nEpisode_Number\nSeason\nn\n\n\n\n\n10\n8\n13\n\n\n18\n9\n13\n\n\n6\n1\n11\n\n\n23\n3\n11\n\n\n23\n9\n11\n\n\n5\n9\n8\n\n\n13\n7\n8\n\n\n1\n1\n7\n\n\n4\n1\n7\n\n\n16\n9\n7\n\n\n6\n6\n6\n\n\n7\n9\n6\n\n\n12\n8\n6\n\n\n14\n2\n6\n\n\n15\n5\n6\n\n\n4\n5\n5\n\n\n4\n6\n5\n\n\n4\n9\n5\n\n\n5\n8\n5\n\n\n6\n5\n5\n\n\n18\n3\n5\n\n\n19\n3\n5\n\n\n20\n8\n5\n\n\n26\n5\n5\n\n\n1\n3\n4\n\n\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n2\n2\n4\n\n\n3\n8\n4\n\n\n4\n3\n4\n\n\n5\n1\n4\n\n\n6\n7\n4\n\n\n6\n9\n4\n\n\n8\n3\n4\n\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n\n10\n3\n4\n\n\n10\n5\n4\n\n\n13\n4\n4\n\n\n13\n9\n4\n\n\n14\n7\n4\n\n\n14\n8\n4\n\n\n17\n8\n4\n\n\n19\n7\n4\n\n\n21\n7\n4\n\n\n21\n8\n4\n\n\n22\n2\n4\n\n\n24\n5\n4\n\n\n24\n8\n4\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n2\n1\n3\n\n\n2\n4\n3\n\n\n3\n2\n3\n\n\n3\n9\n3\n\n\n5\n5\n3\n\n\n6\n3\n3\n\n\n7\n2\n3\n\n\n7\n5\n3\n\n\n7\n8\n3\n\n\n8\n8\n3\n\n\n9\n2\n3\n\n\n9\n8\n3\n\n\n14\n5\n3\n\n\n15\n7\n3\n\n\n19\n9\n3\n\n\n1\n6\n2\n\n\n2\n8\n2\n\n\n3\n1\n2\n\n\n4\n7\n2\n\n\n5\n2\n2\n\n\n5\n4\n2\n\n\n7\n6\n2\n\n\n8\n5\n2\n\n\n8\n9\n2\n\n\n9\n3\n2\n\n\n9\n4\n2\n\n\n9\n6\n2\n\n\n9\n7\n2\n\n\n10\n2\n2\n\n\n10\n7\n2\n\n\n11\n7\n2\n\n\n12\n4\n2\n\n\n12\n9\n2\n\n\n13\n2\n2\n\n\n13\n6\n2\n\n\n13\n8\n2\n\n\n14\n4\n2\n\n\n14\n9\n2\n\n\n15\n8\n2\n\n\n16\n3\n2\n\n\n16\n7\n2\n\n\n16\n8\n2\n\n\n17\n3\n2\n\n\n17\n6\n2\n\n\n18\n2\n2\n\n\n18\n7\n2\n\n\n19\n2\n2\n\n\n19\n6\n2\n\n\n20\n2\n2\n\n\n20\n7\n2\n\n\n21\n3\n2\n\n\n22\n3\n2\n\n\n22\n7\n2\n\n\n23\n5\n2\n\n\n24\n7\n2\n\n\n1\n5\n1\n\n\n2\n3\n1\n\n\n2\n9\n1\n\n\n3\n3\n1\n\n\n3\n6\n1\n\n\n4\n2\n1\n\n\n4\n4\n1\n\n\n4\n8\n1\n\n\n5\n3\n1\n\n\n5\n7\n1\n\n\n6\n4\n1\n\n\n7\n7\n1\n\n\n8\n2\n1\n\n\n9\n5\n1\n\n\n10\n6\n1\n\n\n11\n3\n1\n\n\n11\n4\n1\n\n\n11\n6\n1\n\n\n11\n8\n1\n\n\n11\n9\n1\n\n\n12\n2\n1\n\n\n12\n6\n1\n\n\n12\n7\n1\n\n\n13\n5\n1\n\n\n15\n2\n1\n\n\n16\n5\n1\n\n\n17\n2\n1\n\n\n18\n6\n1\n\n\n18\n8\n1\n\n\n19\n5\n1\n\n\n19\n8\n1\n\n\n20\n3\n1\n\n\n20\n5\n1\n\n\n21\n2\n1\n\n\n21\n6\n1\n\n\n22\n6\n1\n\n\n23\n8\n1"
